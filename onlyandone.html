        <h1>For Ayat My Only and One ❤️</h1>
        <p>
            I don't even know where to begin, because words will never be enough to express what you mean to me. From the moment you came into my life on October 5th, 2023, everything changed. You became my light, my peace, and the best person I've ever met. You're not just someone I love; you're my soul, my heart, and my everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know these past days haven't been easy for us. I know my actions have hurt you, and I've made mistakes that made you question us. I can see how tired you are, and it breaks my heart because I never wanted to be the reason for your pain. I've been selfish, and I've taken your love for granted. But I want you to know something, Ya Rohi I see it now. I see how much I've failed you, and I'm so sorry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose us. You're the most important person in my life, and I'm ready to change. I want to be the man you deserve someone who supports you, understands you, and makes you feel loved every single day. I want to be your safe place, your best friend, and the person who makes you smile even on your hardest days.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know there's distance between us, but my love for you knows no boundaries. No matter how far apart we are, my heart is always with you. You're my home, Ayat, and I'll do whatever it takes to prove to you that I can be better for you, for us, and for the future I dream of sharing with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Valentine's Day, I don't just want to celebrate love; I want to celebrate you. You're my miracle, my strength, and my reason to be a better person. Please don't give up on me, Ya Rohi. I'm here, and I'm ready to fight for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you more than words can ever say, and I'll spend every day showing you just how much you mean to me.
        </p>
